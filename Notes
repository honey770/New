JDK install 
Java Development Kit
contains :
JRE which is Java Runtime Enviornment 
which contain :
JVM which is Java virtual machine

JVM runs or java code.JVM can only understand byte code(0,1)

So,We first we have to compile our .java file 
.java -> .class  this is a byte code
JVM will understand the .class file and exicute our file 


In project we have multiple file 
but only one file can contain the "main function "

    public static void main(String a[]){

    }

And .java file should contian in a class 

class className{
   body...  
}

"jshell" is also a way to run our one line code.
We can run jshell on cmd;
This will run our code


Next,

We have different type of Data Types
Primitive:
1.Integer -> byte,short,int,long
2.Float   ->double,float
3.Character
4.Boolean

Integer :-
int=4bytes (default)
long=8bytes for using long we have to use "l" as postfix eg. long l=2342354253l;
short=2bytes
byte=1byte(8 bits)  -> -128 to 127

Float :-
float=4bytes
for using float in java we have to use "f" as postfix eg. float num=23.3f;
double=8bytes (default)

character :-
char=2bytes
Unicode not ASCII

char c='k';

Boolean :-
true and false not (0,1)

boolean b=true;
