************************************ 10/6/2023 ************************************

JDK install 
Java Development Kit
contains :
JRE which is Java Runtime Enviornment 
which contain :
JVM which is Java virtual machine

JVM runs or java code.JVM can only understand byte code(0,1)

So,We first we have to compile our .java file 
.java -> .class  this is a byte code
JVM will understand the .class file and exicute our file 


In project we have multiple file 
but only one file can contain the "main function "

    public static void main(String a[]){

    }

And .java file should contian in a class 

class className{
   body...  
}

"jshell" is also a way to run our one line code.
We can run jshell on cmd;
This will run our code


Next,

We have different type of Data Types
Primitive:
1.Integer -> byte,short,int,long
2.Float   ->double,float
3.Character
4.Boolean

Integer :-
int=4bytes (default)
long=8bytes for using long we have to use "l" as postfix eg. long l=2342354253l;
short=2bytes
byte=1byte(8 bits)  -> -128 to 127

Float :-
float=4bytes
for using float in java we have to use "f" as postfix eg. float num=23.3f;
double=8bytes (default)

character :-
char=2bytes
Unicode not ASCII

char c='k';

Boolean :-
true and false not (0,1)

boolean b=true;

************************************ 11/6/2023 ************************************

Literals :-

Literals in Java are a synthetic representation of boolean, character, numeric, or string data. They are a means of 
expressing particular values within a program. They are constant values that directly appear in a program and can be assigned now to a variable.

int num=0b101; for Binary Number
int num=0x101E for Hexadecimal Number

int num=1000000;
int num=100_00_00; We can write our number in this format also using "_" 
The out put will be same.

double num=23e10;

char c='a';

Type Conversion and Casting :-

byte b=127;
int a=256;

b=a; (Not posible)
a=b;

if you want to change integer into byte:
    if the value of 'a' is in a range:
        a=123;
        b=(byte)a;

if the a=257:
    java will type caste 'a' to byte using modulo method.
    257%256 where 256 is the range of the byte.
    and returns 1;

float f=3.3f;
int x=(int)f;

Type Permotion:-

byte a=12;
byte b=32;

if you perform an operation like * the value will go out of range.
This value will be permoted to int value

int result =a*b;

Assignment operator:-

=
+=    
-=
*=
/=
%=

++  inrement (post and pre)
--  decrement (post and pre)

int result=num++; // it will first fetch the value of num and then increment;
int reuslt=++num; // it will first increment and then fetch the value;

 
class className{

    public static void main(String args[]){

        int num1=32;
        int num2=34;

        int result=num1%num2;

        num1=num1+2;

        num1 +=2;


    }
}


Relational Operator:-

>
<
==
!=
>=
<=


Logical Operators:-

&&
||  (Short Circuit)
!


************************************ 12/6/2023 ************************************

Conditional Statements:-


    Ternary Operator are used to perform one line if else condition.

    Switch Statements 

Loops in java:

    for
    while 
    do while 
    Nested loops 

    loop(){
        loop(){}
    }

    for loop as while loop :-

    int  i=23; // intisilised 

    for(;i>34;){
        i++
    }

************************************ 13/6/2023 ************************************

Class and Object in java :-

    Every object know something and do something .
    Every this is an object.

    Object oriented programing 
    object can have properties and behaviour.

    Class are the blueprint of object.

    JVM will creates an object.



JDK contains JRE which contains JVM which run our byte code.
JRE (Java Runtime Enviornment) give a place to store the spotted file which are being exicuted in the JVM 


main() method is the from which the exicution started.

Method overloading
    Having same name with different parameters.

************************************ 14/6/2023 ************************************


Stack and Heap :-

1) Memory management in java and typed of categories to store data in memory.
2)What is stack ?
3)What is heap ?
4) where instance variable and local variable is allocated?

#1
In java we are managing our managing our memory using two data structure stack and heap.
two categories to store data in memory:
1) Stack data structure
2) heap data structure

#2
Stack is data structure which follow LIFO(Last in First Out) principle.

#3
heap is data structure which is used to store data in form of object and object is a collection of data and method.

#4
class Student{
    int instVariable; //store in object and object created in heap
    public static void main(String []args){
        int localVariable=0;      //local variable store in stack frame of method in stack area.
        Student st=new Student(); //st is reference variable store address of new Student() object
    }

    public int add(int num1,int num2){
        return num1+num2;
    }
}

-- instance variable stored in object and object are in heap therefore we can say that instance variable created in heap.
-- method declaration and definition is present in object but actual implementation present in stack frame of stack.
-- local variable created in stack during call of method.
-- stack frame of called method is present in stack area.
-- st is reference variable created inside the current stack frame and it is reference variable store address of student object created in heap area.
-- new Student() create object in heap area and pointed by his reference variable.

Array:-

In this lecture we are discussing:
1)What is an Array ?
2)Why do we need array?
3)Simple variable declaration vs Array variable declaration

#1
-- An array is collection of similar type of data and store  in contagious memory.
-- e.g marks is collection of different marks obtained by 4 student then {24,25,26,27} is that marks then 
this marks store in contagious manner in memory.

#2
Why so we need array?
-- suppose we want to create five variable for student marks 
-- int m1=24; int m2=25; int m3=26; int m4=27; int m5=28;
-- it is quite tedious to store multiple value in multiple variable and remember the marks.
-- now one reason is that to create single variable which can store multiple value and access by its index.

#3
Simple variable declaration vs Array variable declaration
-- for creating normal variable
int num; boolean result=true;

-- for creating array variable 
int nums []; or int []nums; -- both are acceptable to declare array variable
